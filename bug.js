This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `app.json` configuration.  The error message is cryptic and doesn't point directly to the problem in `app.json`.  The app builds fine on iOS but fails on Android.  The issue seems to stem from a conflict or misconfiguration within the `expo.android.package` name, specifically when it doesn't align with the actual Android project structure and settings.  The Android project might have a different package name set, leading to inconsistencies.  The error doesn't always surface immediately; it might manifest only during later stages of the build process.
